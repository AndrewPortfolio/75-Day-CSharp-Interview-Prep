- Spent most of the time today trying to setup the C# environment/figuring out the basics with structs and classes
- Ran into a lot of errors with how to run the files and the syntax/setup to run the code that I wrote
- Definetly want start coding more complex problems tomorrow now that I have most of the basics down
