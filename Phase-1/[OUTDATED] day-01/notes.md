Searched up how to: makefile, dicts, how types work in python, how to print a range of numbers in python, how to remove whitespace in a string 

Issues that I ran into were at first initializing variables. Realized after a few seconds that I don't need to follow c syntax (int x= 0) I could just type it out.

FizzBuzz and is Palindrome function. FizzBuzz was super easy, and as embarrasing as it sounds I wasn't able to get is_Palindrome without any help 😐. The issue was because I incorrectly tried to remove whitespace s.replace(" ", ""). I didn't set s = to that so I kept getting false. Otherwise, my logic was fine even if it was complicated!!
