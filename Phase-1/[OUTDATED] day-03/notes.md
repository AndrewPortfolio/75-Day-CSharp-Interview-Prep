- Didn't have much time today
- Worked on only Word Freq
    - Messed up on it bc I am still thinking in terms of indices instead of tokens
    - Also I am stuck in C++ thinking about control and indices when I should focus more on pythong tools (i.e. .split())
- Didn't get to Two sum I will redo these two tomorrow again as well
