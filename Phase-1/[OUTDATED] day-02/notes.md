Practiced string, list, and dict manipulation. Normalized data, append, sort, reverse, etc. 

Search ups: 
    Strings:
        upper(), strip(), join(), isalnum, Counter
    List: 
        extend()
    Dict: 
        d[key] syntax, update(), pop()

Learned how to join together 2 strings or a list of characters. Practiced on 2 easy leetcode problems Word Frequency and Two sum. 
Word Frequency: I created the wrong solution. I was iterating characters not words 
Two Sum: Brute forced it. Created buggy nested for loop bc I initialized start to 1 instead of i. 

ChatGpt Grading: 
Word_Freq: you didn’t implement the actual problem (word frequency). You implemented a broken character-count attempt. Rewrite it using split() + dict counting.

Two_sum: you’re close, but you need j = i+1 and return indices (or a consistent result type). The hash map version is what you should aim to memorize.

My Thoughts: Long and stressful day so I am proud of myself for sitting down to code. I had fun with what I was doing and had a good time. Brute forced both word_freq nd two_sum, should've gave myself some time to think about how to get to the solution but went straight into coding without building a solid mental model. Day 3 I want to tackle these problems again and fix my mistakes.
